## About
This is the landing page for [zyradyl.moe][1].

## Domains
- [https://zyradyl.moe][1]

## History
Originally hosted on [Github][3], then moved to [Gitlab][4], now back to Github.
Did use [Netlify][5] for a while, back when they offered minifying services. Now
just relying on the [Cloudflare][6] CDN, since Cloudflare is growing to consume
everything anyways.

## Licenses
- Code: [UNLICENSE][7]
- Content: [CC0][8]

## Notes
Pretty sure this was cobbled together from a late night stack overflow bender,
and as such the right to put a license on any of this is dubious at best. But I
do anything I can to elevate the status of [UNLICENSE][9] on Github.
